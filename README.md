# Handwritten-Signature-Verification-using-Siamese-Network-and-Harris-Corner-Detection-Algorithm

"For centuries, signatures have served as a means to confirm a person's identity. However, manually verifying signatures is error-prone. The process of signature verification is complex due to the potential for skilled counterfeiters to replicate signature patterns, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive information. This poses security risks such as unauthorized access to personal data, manipulation of valid IDs, and fraudulent modification of property documents. This research proposes a solution that combines edge detection algorithms and deep neural networks. This combination effectively detects and authenticates genuine signatures with a high level of accuracy. This advancement aims to enhance the process of authorizing original signatures, reducing errors, and ensuring robust signature verification in online contexts."
